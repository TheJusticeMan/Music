			<div class="track-container">
				<h3>The Story Behind 'Epic Bitcrush'</h3>
				<p>'Epic Bitcrush' came from a loop I made while sitting in church an hour before service. A few weeks later, I had played that loop so many times, and it felt so perfect. I decided to turn it into a song, so on a Saturday, I listened to it all day long, making it into a full track. By the end, I could just keep listening—it never got boring.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="track-container" style="display:none;">
				<h3>The Story Behind 'KKBZ'</h3>
				<p>'KKBZ' was a journey into powerful beats and minimalism. Inspired by the retro-futuristic aesthetic of square mountains and a vibrant purple sky, this track came to life with a deep bassline and drums that pulse with a distinct 'thump thump space space' rhythm. It’s a blend of techno and dance that evolved from layers of melodies until it was just right. The track reflects both the complexity of creation and the simplicity that makes music unforgettable.</p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="track-container">
				<h3>The Story Behind 'Why Balloons Don’t Pop'</h3>
				<p>'Why Balloons Don’t Pop' started as a lighthearted experiment. While playing with a balloon and thinking about bass drum and bass guitar, I noticed that a gentle clap against the balloon produced a low-pitched rumble. That single sound inspired me to build an entire track, using the rumble as the foundation. The result is a unique, creative piece that was released just before my birthday—a perfect celebration of fun and sound experimentation.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h3>Justice Vellacott: My Creative Journey</h3>
			<p>From a young age, I’ve been deeply intrigued by the way things work, especially when it came to computers
				and sound. Growing up without internet access, I had to rely on my curiosity and determination to figure
				things out in unconventional ways. I would take apart files, apps, and anything digital I could get my
				hands on. It was through this unique exploration that I developed my creative methods—finding out how
				sound works by breaking down WAV files, and even building simple apps to create sounds. This was how my
				first melody came to life, just from a curiosity to understand.</p>
			<p>I grew up in a very secluded environment, which meant that for most of my childhood, socializing wasn’t
				part of my daily life. I spent my time on a farm, often disconnected from anyone outside of my siblings.
				But everything changed when my family eventually left my father. Suddenly, we were opening ourselves up
				to a broader world—one filled with other people, friends, and experiences beyond our small world. This
				new chapter allowed me to learn what it meant to share ideas, stories, and music with others.</p>
			<p>One of my favorite stories from my creative journey is the making of "Why Balloons Don’t Pop." The idea
				came to me simply from the quirky, squeaky sound a balloon makes. I thought, "What if I could turn that
				into a full track?" I challenged myself to take just one sample of a balloon sound and create an entire
				song out of it. The result was an incredibly unique piece that ended up being released just before my
				birthday—fitting, given the associations of balloons with celebrations. It was a fun and lighthearted
				project that pushed my boundaries of creativity.</p>
